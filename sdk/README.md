# Alembic SDK

Use the Alembic SDK Crate to write client side applications in Rust.  If writing on-chain programs, use the [Alembic Program Crate](https://crates.io/crates/Alembic-program) instead.

More information about Alembic is available in the [Alembic documentation](https://genesisaddress.ai/docs).

The [Alembic Program Library](https://github.com/Alembic-labs/Alembic-program-library) provides examples of how to use this crate.
