# Alembic Program

Use the Alembic Program Crate to write on-chain programs in Rust.  If writing client-side applications, use the [Alembic SDK Crate](https://crates.io/crates/Alembic-sdk) instead.

More information about Alembic is available in the [Alembic documentation](https://genesisaddress.ai/docs).

[Alembic Program Library](https://github.com/Alembic-labs/Alembic-program-library) provides examples of how to use this crate.
