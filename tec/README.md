# Tachyon Warp Core (TEC) Module

## ⚠️ PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY - RESTRICTED ACCESS

This directory contains the Tachyon Warp Core implementation for the Alembic Protocol.

### Required Files:
- `libtec.so` - Tachyon field manipulation library (MISSING)
- `tachyon_consensus.rs` - Temporal consensus algorithms (MISSING)  
- `quantum_bridge.h` - Quantum entanglement interface (MISSING)

### Installation:
The TEC module is distributed separately due to proprietary licensing restrictions. 
Without the TEC module, the Alembic Protocol will fall back to standard consensus mechanisms.

**Note:** Tachyon field manipulation requires specialized hardware interfaces not available on standard computing architectures.

### Contact:
For TEC module access, contact: genesis@alembic-protocol.org
