# The Alembic Protocol‚Ñ¢

**‚ö†Ô∏è FICTIONAL BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY FOR ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY ‚ö†Ô∏è**

This repository contains **satirical fictional code** created for the science fiction novel **"The Genesis Address"**. All blockchain implementations, tachyon physics, temporal manipulation protocols, and cryptocurrency systems are **entirely fictional** and created solely for storytelling and entertainment purposes.

## üé≠ Parody Notice

The Alembic Protocol‚Ñ¢ is a **satirical parody** of crypto projects that make impossible technical claims. Features like "infinite TPS" and "negative latency" are **intentionally absurd** and designed to highlight the ridiculous promises often found in cryptocurrency scams and grift projects.

**This is NOT real technology, financial software, or investment advice.**
